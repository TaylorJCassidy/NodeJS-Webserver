# NodeJS Webserver
A webserver written in JavaScript for use with NodeJS.

This project more of a proof of concept to help my overall understanding of the web and web technologies rather than a pratical webserver solution.

Use at your own risk as this is almost certainly unsecure in ways I haven't even imagined possible.
